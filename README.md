# barcodeScanner
Barcode Portal App - Final Project Mobile Programming

This app is programmed using React Native and the Expo CLI.

Assuming that you have Node 12 LTS or greater installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:

npm install -g expo-cli

Then navigate to the directory where the entire project is located and type the following:

"expo install expo-barcode-scanner"

"npm install axios"

"expo start" 

"npm start" will work as well..

You will have to install the Expo Go Application on your phone to be able to see the app actually running on your phone, but you can also use an emulator.

Once you type expo start, you will be taken to an Expo web interface that is connected to the app, and you will have a QR code to scan to run the app on your phone, 
but you must scan the QR code inside the Expo Go app if you are on android, or you can use your phone camera on iOS devices (still must have Expo Go installed).  

Then scan away! Have fun!
