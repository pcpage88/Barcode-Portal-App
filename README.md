Barcode Portal App - Final Project Mobile Programming

This app is programmed using React Native and the Expo CLI.

Assuming that you have Node 12 LTS or greater installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:

npm install -g expo-cli

Then navigate to the directory where the entire project is located and type the following:

expo start 

"npm start" will work as well..

Then scan a barcode and see the magic happen
